# Slim-Drira
Portefolio
I'm Slim Drira, ERP-Business Intelligence Developer.

About Me:
I am Slim Drira, a passionate Business Intelligence Developer with a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization. Currently pursuing my engineering degree at ESPRIT, I have honed my skills in Business Intelligence, Data Modeling, and Machine Learning, equipping me with the tools to tackle complex data challenges.

During my internships at Star Assurances and SRA Integration, I successfully developed interactive dashboards and optimized key performance indicators, driving significant improvements in efficiency and customer satisfaction. My hands-on experience with ETL processes and BI tools such as Power BI, Talend, and Apache Superset has enabled me to streamline data reporting and provide actionable insights.

I thrive in dynamic environments where I can leverage my technical expertise in programming languages like Python, Java, and SQL, along with my knowledge of Big Data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark. Committed to continuous learning and innovation, I am excited about the potential of data-driven solutions to transform businesses and enhance decision-making processes.

In addition to my technical capabilities, I am known for my adaptability, critical thinking, and collaborative spirit, making me a valuable asset to any team. I am eager to contribute to projects that prioritize user needs and drive positive outcomes in the realm of Business Intelligence.
